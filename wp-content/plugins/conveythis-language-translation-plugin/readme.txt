== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When will you be adding support for new languages? =

Since the button only uses Google Translate, we have no control of when new languages will be available. Once Google 
does add a new language, we try to add support for that language as quickly as possible.

= Google added a new language, and it's not available through ConveyThis. Why is that? =

When Google adds a new language it is not automatically available through ConveyThis. This is because we must make internal changes 
to our program telling it the language is available and how to handle it. Also, we need to add a flag image for that language. We make every 
effort to keep the translator's available language list as up to date as possible.

= Can you translate my blog without redirecting through a separate frame? =

If you have a Google Translate API Key and a [registered ConveyThis account](http://www.conveythis.com/) you can enter your username on the settings 
page to translate directly through Google. Note that this process is a bit technical, and while ConveyThis does not charge for this service, Google 
does charge for use of its API, so be sure to read up on [how to create an API key](https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/getting_started#setup) and 
[Google's pricing structure](https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/pricing).
